# intro2R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of intro2R is to introduce new users to R and the Tidyverse.

## Installation

You can install the development version of intro2R from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# install.packages("learnr")
devtools::install_github("mwaak/intro2R")
```

## Example

To run the tutorial in your local web browser, you can run the following code in the R Console. This will open the tutorial, which will also interact with RStudio. I recommend having both the tutorial and RStudio windows visible side-by-side.

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(intro2R)

learnr::run_tutorial("intro2R", "intro2R")
```
